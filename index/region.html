			<h3>Dobrudzha region</h3>
               <p class="text">With the exception of the Danube Delta, a marshy region located in its northeastern corner, Dobruja is hilly, with an average altitude of about 200–300 metres. The highest point is the Țuțuiatu (Greci) Peak in the Măcin Mountains, having a height of 467 m. The Dobruja Plateau covers most of the Romanian part of Dobruja. The Ludogorie Plateau is found in Bulgaria. Lake Razelm is one of the most important lakes in Northern Dobruja.<span class="dots"> ...</span> <span class="moreText">Dobruja lies in the temperate continental climatic area; the local climate is determined by the influx of oceanic air from the northwest and northeast and continental air from the East European Plain. Dobruja's relatively level terrain and its bare location facilitate the influx of humid, warm air in the spring, summer and autumn from the northwest, as well as that of northern and northeastern polar air in the winter. The Black Sea also exerts an influence over the region's climate, particularly within 40–60 kilometres from the coast. The average annual temperatures range from 11 °C inland and along the Danube, to 11.8 °C on the coast and less than 10 °C in the higher parts of the plateau. The coastal region of Southern Dobruja is the most arid part of Bulgaria, with an annual precipitation of 450 millimetres.</span></p>

			<h3>Norten Region</h3>
             <p class="text">Parts of Burgas Province, Sliven Province, and Sofia Province also geographically belong to Northern Bulgaria. Northern Bulgaria covers the historical region of Moesia, which in turn includes several sub-regions such as Dobruja (sometimes not considered part of Moesia), Ludogorie, Gerlovo and Zlatiya. Northern Bulgaria is also conventionally divided into Northwestern, Central Northern and Northeastern Bulgaria, with slightly varying borders.<span class="dots"> ...</span> <span class="moreText">The lower northern reaches of the Balkan Mountains are called the Fore-Balkan, as opposed to the Sub-Balkan valleys to the south of the main ridge. In Antiquity, the Jireček Line divided Latin (in the north) and Ancient Greek (in the south) language influence in the Balkans, with Northern Bulgaria to the north of it and Southern Bulgaria to the south. Much later, after the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, all of Northern Bulgaria and the region of Sofia became the Principality of Bulgaria while most of the rest of Southern Bulgaria was part of Eastern Rumelia until the Bulgarian unification in 1885.</span></p>
